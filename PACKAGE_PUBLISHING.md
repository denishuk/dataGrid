# NPM Package Publishing Guide

## React Version Compatibility Update

### Issue Fixed
The package now supports React 18.x, 19.x, and future versions by using `>=18.0.0` peer dependencies instead of `^18.0.0`.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated peer dependencies** in `npm-package/package.json`:
   ```json
   "peerDependencies": {
     "react": ">=18.0.0",
     "react-dom": ">=18.0.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Updated dev dependencies** for broader compatibility:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "@types/react": ">=18.0.0",
     "@types/react-dom": ">=18.0.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Version bumped** to 1.5.9 with comprehensive changelog
